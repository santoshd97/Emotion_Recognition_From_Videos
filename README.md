# Emotion Recognition From Videos

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Many companies use sentiment analysis to understand their customers’ reactions to their products. Primarily, these analyses have been carried out on social media and text information.</p><p>However, recently companies have started using multimodal analyses to understand their customers’ reactions in much more details. This project is based on bimodal sentimental analysis, where we utilize textual as well as speech signals to detect emotions.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol><li>We want to understand which features play an important role in speech signals with regards to emotions. For this, we want to look into the theory to understand how human emotions and vocal responses are related. We also want to investigate through experimentation with feature selection.</li>
<li>We want to understand whether through textual sentiment analysis, we can detect contextual emotions associated with certain words, for example, positive words used in a negative sentence to convey sarcasm.</li>
<li>We also want to see if both textual and speech sentiment analysis result can be combined to provide better result than each used independently.</li>
